## Who am I? üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm an enthusiastic C# developer with over a decade of experience under my belt. I've honed my skills in a plethora of technologies, platforms, and environments - from SQL Server, .Net Framework and .Net Core, to Azure and Git. My love for coding is only surpassed by my love for learning and sharing knowledge.

With a career evolved from being a dedicated developer to a team lead, I've had the privilege to guide and mentor several junior engineers and watched them grow into proficient contributors to our field. I believe in the power of a strong team and the transformative impact of supportive leadership.

## What's next on my learning roadmap? üß≠

You're never too experienced to stop learning, right? Here are the technologies I'm planning to explore next:

1. Containerization of .Net apps
2. Non-relational databases
3. Kafka messaging

I'm always open to suggestions, so feel free to recommend something that caught your interest!
